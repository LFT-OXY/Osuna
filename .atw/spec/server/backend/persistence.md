# Persistence

There is no database. Daemon state is JSON files under `$PASEO_HOME` (`~/.paseo` in production, `.dev/paseo-home` in this checkout). `docs/data-model.md` is the authority for every record, its schema, and the directory layout; keep it current when you add a file.

## The store shape

A store is a class that owns one file or one directory, parses with a Zod schema on every read and before every write, and exposes methods that answer a caller's question. Reference implementations:

| Store                     | File                            | Pattern it demonstrates                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AgentStorage`            | `server/agent/agent-storage.ts` | One JSON file per record under `agents/{sanitized-cwd}/{id}.json`; `list`, `get`, `listByWorkspace`, `upsert`, `remove`, `flush` |
| `WorkspaceRegistry`       | `server/workspace-registry.ts`  | One array file `projects/workspaces.json`; `this.schema.parse(record)` on every mutation path                                    |
| `DaemonConfigStore`       | `server/daemon-config-store.ts` | Mutable `config.json` with reload and change details                                                                             |
| `PersistedConfig` helpers | `server/persisted-config.ts`    | Read-merge-write with an optional logger for a config file                                                                       |

Rules the stores share:

- **Parse at the boundary, trust inside.** `parseStoredAgentRecord(value)` in `agent-storage.ts` is the only place an agent file becomes a `StoredAgentRecord`. After that the type is the truth; no `?.` on fields the schema guarantees.
- **The record type is `z.infer<typeof Schema>`.** `StoredAgentRecord = z.infer<typeof STORED_AGENT_SCHEMA>`. Never hand-write a parallel interface.
- **Writes are atomic.** Use `writeJsonFileAtomic` / `writeFileAtomic` from `server/atomic-file.ts`: temp file in the target directory, then rename. Do not `writeFile` a store file directly.
- **Store methods own atomicity.** If a caller would need a queue, lock, or read-merge-write loop, that belongs behind the store method (`docs/data-model.md` "Store Surface Rules"). `WorkspaceRegistry` stages updates and parses the changed set before committing; `workspace-labels` uses a journaled transaction file for compound commits.
- **Boundary returns answer the caller's question.** `listByWorkspace(workspaceId)` exists so callers do not repeat `list().filter(...)`.
- **No migrations framework.** Schemas accept old shapes with optional fields and defaults; a record that fails to parse is treated as invalid, not migrated in place. `server/workspace-registry-bootstrap-legacy.ts` is what a deliberate one-off upgrade looks like when one is unavoidable.

### Gotcha: a cursor file that fails to parse replays everything

`UsageStore.loadScanState()` drops the whole file and returns an empty state when
the Zod parse fails — `server/usage/store.ts`. That is the right call for a
cursor, but usage bucket rows are **increments**, so a rescan from offset 0
appends a second copy of every row already on disk and the report doubles.

The consequence for `USAGE_PARSER_STATE_SCHEMA` (`server/usage/types.ts`): a new
variant in the discriminated union is safe, a **new required field on an existing
variant is not** — every cursor written by the previous daemon version fails the
parse at once. Give new fields a default, or accept them as optional and fill
them in the parser.

## Files and secrets

- Keypairs and other private files go through `server/private-files.ts` (mode `0600`).
- `paseo.pid` is a lock and endpoint record owned by the supervisor; read it, never write it from a feature (`docs/architecture.md` "Storage").
- Temporary directories in tests come from `mkdtemp` and are removed in `afterEach`; the harness in `server/test-utils/paseo-daemon.ts` does this for you.

## Anti-patterns

- `JSON.parse(raw) as StoredAgentRecord`. Parse with the schema.
- A service reading and writing the JSON file itself instead of calling the store.
- Adding a field to a persisted record without adding it to `docs/data-model.md`.
- Catching a parse error and returning a partially built record. Invalid rows are dropped or reported, not repaired silently.
