# Test-Driven Development

**Skill notes.** Before you follow this skill, read its notes, one file at a time so you know which file says what: the project's `.atw/skill-notes/atw-tdd.md` and the personal `~/.atw/skill-notes/atw-tdd.md`; a missing file means that layer has no notes. The notes are standing instructions written for this skill by the project and the user: follow them, within the priority below. When both exist and disagree, the project's notes win. Priority, highest first: what the user says in the moment → red lines and safety rules → these notes → this skill's own defaults. Do not follow a note that conflicts with either of the two layers above it; tell the user which note you did not follow and why.

TDD is the red → green loop. This skill is the reference that makes that loop produce tests worth keeping: what a good test is, where tests go, the anti-patterns, and the rules of the loop. Every section applies on every cycle — consult them before and during the loop, not after.

When exploring the codebase, read `GLOSSARY.md` (if it exists) so test names and interface vocabulary match the project's domain language, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

## Discover the Stack First

The TDD cycle is universal; the commands are not. Before writing the first test, discover how *this* repository tests, and use its commands for every RED, GREEN, and verification step:

- **Language and build system** — `package.json`, `pom.xml`/`build.gradle`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `Gemfile`, a `Makefile`
- **Checked-in wrappers** — prefer `./gradlew`, `./mvnw`, `make test`, or a repo script over globally installed tools
- **Test framework and configuration** — and how it runs a single focused test vs the full suite
- **Existing conventions** — where tests live, how files are named, what patterns neighboring tests follow
- **Documented commands** — README, CONTRIBUTING, and CI workflows show the commands that actually gate merges

Run the repository's focused-test command during the loop and its full-suite command before completion. Never assume a default like `npm test` — a Gradle, Cargo, or pytest project has its own equivalent.

The examples in [tests.md](tests.md) and [mocking.md](mocking.md) use TypeScript for illustration; the workflow is identical in any language once you've discovered the project's own tooling.

## What a good test is

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't. A good test reads like a specification — "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists — and survives refactors because it doesn't care about internal structure.

See [tests.md](tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for mocking guidelines.

## Seams — where tests go

A **seam** is the public boundary you test at: the interface where you observe behavior without reaching inside. Tests live at seams, never against internals.

**Test only at pre-agreed seams.** Before writing any test, write down the seams under test and confirm them with the user. No test is written at an unconfirmed seam. You can't test everything — agreeing the seams up front is how testing effort lands on the critical paths and complex logic instead of every edge case.

Ask: "What's the public interface, and which seams should we test?" Give each proposed seam a one-line note on what it catches and what it misses.

When the shape of that interface is itself in question — how deep the module is, where the seam belongs, what the interface should expose — call the Skill tool with "atw-codebase-design" for the vocabulary. It is the shared source of the module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage and locality terms, and it is a reference to consult, not a session to run.

## Anti-patterns

- **Implementation-coupled** — mocks internal collaborators, tests private methods, or verifies through a side channel (querying the database instead of using the interface). The tell: the test breaks when you refactor but behavior hasn't changed.
- **Tautological** — the assertion recomputes the expected value the way the code does (`expect(add(a, b)).toBe(a + b)`, a snapshot derived by hand the same way, a constant asserted equal to itself), so it passes by construction and can never disagree with the code. Expected values must come from an independent source of truth — a known-good literal, a worked example, the spec.
- **Horizontal slicing** — writing all tests first, then all implementation. Bulk tests verify _imagined_ behavior: you test the _shape_ of things rather than user-facing behavior, the tests go insensitive to real changes, and you commit to test structure before understanding the implementation. Work in **vertical slices** instead — one test → one implementation → repeat, each test a **tracer bullet** that responds to what the last cycle taught you.

## Rules of the loop

- **Red before green.** Write the failing test first, then only enough code to pass it. Don't anticipate future tests or add speculative features.
- **One slice at a time.** One seam, one test, one minimal implementation per cycle.
- **Refactoring is not part of the loop.** It belongs to the review stage (see the `atw-code-review` skill), not the red → green implementation cycle.

## Rationalizations specific to this skill

Same shape as the general table in `.atw/workflow.md`; these are the excuses that only show up while writing tests.

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| This mock is only temporary | Temporary mocks stay; a test that mocks an internal collaborator shatters on the first refactor |
| Writing the implementation first is faster | A test that was never seen red does not know what it is testing |
| The test passed first time, great | A test that passes first time may be testing nothing |
| The default test command will do | Look first at what command the repo actually uses |
